# Nova Forma Designs

This is the official repository for **Nova Forma Designs**, a freelance digital design and development business specializing in tailoring digital experiences for small businesses and personal brands.

## Project Origin
This project began as a high-fidelity mockup designed in **Figma** and was subsequently adapted and developed using **Google's new Anti-Gravity IDE**, leveraging advanced AI-assisted coding capabilities to bring the vision to life.

## Business Overview
Nova Forma Designs is the operating name for my freelance digital design and development services. As a sole trader, I provide personalized, high-quality digital solutions for small businesses and personal brands. The business name is currently protected through a private limited company registered with **Companies House**, ensuring brand security and professional standing. This venture stems from my recent qualifications in **UI Design** and **Full Stack Web Development**, which have driven me to establish my own independent business.

The business model is built around transparent pricing tiers and a personalized "tailored" approach to digital solutions, focusing on creating clean, modern, and high-converting websites.
